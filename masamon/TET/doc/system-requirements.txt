System Requirements for PDFlib GmbH Products
============================================

Latest change: 2015-11-03

This document describes the requirements for using PDFlib GmbH binaries on
various platforms. This list covers all platforms on which at least one
product is supported. It should not be construed as a commitment regarding
the availability of product/platform combinations.

To find out whether a PDFlib GmbH product is supported at all on a particular
platform please check the downloadable binary packages which are available
at www.pdflib.com.


================================
Note on 64-bit Intel platforms
================================
Intel uses the term "Intel 64" for a processor architecture which is
known by several other names:
- Intel formerly called it EM64T (after using IA-32e)
- Microsoft and Oracle call it x64
- AMD calls it AMD64 (after using x86-64)
- Linux systems often refer to x86_64

PDFlib GmbH binaries for Intel 64 work on all architectures listed above.
They do not work on Intel Itanium (formerly called IA-64), which is
a separate architecture.
Because of the vendor-specific conventions we continue to use the term "x64"
instead of "Intel 64" in the context of Oracle and Microsoft operating systems. 


================================
Windows
================================

Requirements:
Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10 on x86 or x64
Windows Server 2003/2003 R2/2008/2008 R2/2012/2012 R2 on x86 or x64

.NET binding
------------
The following flavors are supported:
- .NET Framework 2.0 - 3.5
- .NET Framework 4.0 - 4.5
- 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions of the above

See PDFlib-in-.NET-HowTo.pdf for details on .NET configuration.

With ASP.NET 2.0 and above the .NET editions of PDFlib GmbH products require
Full Trust level. They do not work with any other trust level, such as
High or Medium Trust.

C and C++ bindings
------------------
Project files for the programming samples are available for
Visual Studio 2005. Newer versions of Visual Studio can convert these
automatically.

PLOP DS with engine=mscapi requires Windows Vista or above.


================================
Linux
================================
Requirements: GLIBC 2.3 (or later) based system on x86
              GLIBC 2.4 (or later) based system on Intel 64

C and C++ bindings
------------------
Compiler:
    x86: g++ 3.4 or above (gcc 4.0 or above recommended)
    Intel 64: g++ 4.0 or above
    LDFLAGS: "-pthread"

Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Tcl bindings
-------------------------------------------
x86 and Intel 64: libstdc++.so.6


================================
OS X
================================
Requirements: OS X 10.6/10.7/10.8/10.9/10.10 on x86/x64

Note for OS X 10.8 and above:
Since OS X 10.8 the Gatekeeper protection feature blocks unsigned
applications. This applies to all PDFlib GmbH command line tools.
If you want to use these tools on OS X 10.8 or later you must inform
the system that it is a safe application. Override Gatekeeper by
Control-clicking the application icon and select "Open" from the top of
the context menu.
This must be done only once per user account.


C, C++, and Objective-C bindings
--------------------------------
Compiler: Xcode 6 or above


PHP language binding
--------------------
Some combinations of OS X versions and PHP builds result in a crash when
accessing host fonts. As a workaround, host font access can be disabled;
see PDFlib-in-PHP-HowTo.pdf for details. The workaround is also mentioned
in a comment in all PHP samples.

================================
FreeBSD
================================
Requirements:
x86: FreeBSD 7/8/9/10 and compatible systems
Intel 64: FreeBSD 7/8/9/10 and compatible systems

Additional requirement for the Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby and Java language
bindings:
- libstdc++.so.6 must be installed. This can be achieved by adding
  the package /usr/ports/lang/gcc.

Additional requirement for the Ruby language binding in addition to the
above:
- libcrypt.so.5 must be installed. So ruby will be supported with FreeBSD8
  and newer.


================================
AIX
================================
Requirements: AIX 5.2 and compatible systems; currently AIX 6/7

C and C++ bindings
------------------
Compiler: XLC 8.0 or above: you must use a thread-safe variant of the compiler
(such as xlC_r).

g++ is unsupported:
    CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS for g++: "-mxl-compat -pthread"
    LDFLAGS for g++: "-lC -pthread"


================================
HP-UX
================================
Requirements:
HP-UX 11.23 and compatible systems on IA-64
(currently up to 11.31 and 11i v3)

C and C++ bindings
------------------
Compiler: aCC
CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS/LDFLAGS: "-mt" (required for multithreaded applications)
CXXFLAGS/LDFLAGS: "-AA" (required for 2.0 Standard C++ Library)

g++ is unsupported:
    CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS/LDFLAGS for g++: "-lCsup_v2 -pthread",
